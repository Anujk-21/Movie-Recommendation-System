    <h1>Movie Recommendation System</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System GitHub repository! Our project aims to provide users personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and viewing history. Whether you're a cinephile looking for your next favourite film or a casual viewer searching for entertainment, our system has got you covered.</p>
    <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python: We've implemented the recommendation algorithm and backend logic using Python, a versatile and powerful programming language.</li>
        <li>Streamlit: The user interface of our recommendation system is built using Streamlit, a user-friendly Python library for creating interactive web applications.</li>
        <li>Pandas: We use Pandas, a popular data manipulation library in Python, for data preprocessing and analysis.</li>
        <li>Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is employed for implementing machine learning algorithms, specifically for calculating movie similarities using cosine similarity.</li>
        <li>Requests: The Requests library is utilized to fetch data from external APIs, such as The Movie Database (TMDb) and the Open Movie Database (OMDb), for movie information.</li>
        <li>Pickle: Pickle is used for serializing and deserializing Python objects, allowing us to efficiently save and load trained machine-learning models.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data:</h2>
    <p>The data used for this project is sourced from the Top 10K TMDB Movies dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. You can access the dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ahsanaseer/top-rated-tmdb-movies-10k">here</a>. This dataset contains information about popular movies, including titles, overviews, genres, and IMDb ratings.</p>
    <h2>How to Use:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
        <li>Ensure you have Python installed on your system.</li>
        <li>Install the required dependencies listed in the <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</li>
        <li>Run the Streamlit app using the command <code>streamlit run app.py</code>.</li>
